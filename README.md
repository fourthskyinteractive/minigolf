Mini-Golf!
==========

![alt text](http://www.polycount.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/mmp_poster.png "Mini-Golf!")

Starting January 20th, 2014 this contest will be a 4 week affair where artists will be tasked with creating a single mini-putt hole (and a custom golf ball if you'd like!) using Havok's Project Anarchy tools. That's right! Not only will you be creating game art, but you will be designing your own mini-golf level and put it in a brand new game engine! Now that's video game development!

Havok will be on hand to help answer any questions you might have for their tools as well as offer a few video tutorials to get you on your way. Havok has created 4 video tutorials for you on Project Anarchy and how you can use it for the Mini-Golf polycount contest:

* [Part 1][3]
* [Part 2][4]
* [Part 3][5]
* [Part 4][6]
